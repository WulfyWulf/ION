##FW: SINCEREST APOLOGIES
###To: Kavala Office
###From: WEREWOLF SECURITY SERVICES 
***
To the management of the Altis based ION Security Company,

It has come to our attention that one of our security teams at Werewolf Security Services came into contact with members of your company, while on an assignment on the 24th. We understand that our company's involvement significantly interfered with your contract's outcome and would like to offer our strongest apologies over this unfortunate incident. Our security specialists were unaware another company was going to be present during their intervention and were not equipped for an offensive engagement.

We would like to note that, according to our anti-theft devices, one of our company utility vehicles present during the incident has ended up at what appears to be your Charkia office. Werewolf Security Services would like to stress that, despite the unintentional damages caused by our security team, it is strongly against either of our companies' interests to hold either party's property without an arranged deal. We ask you to agree to us taking receipt of the vehicle, one of our company SUVs, immediately.

Again, we extend our deepest regrets for any confusion and ill feelings this unintentional conflict has caused. We always try to arrange a resolution with any other companies we might encounter in the field before it comes to damages to either party. We hope to hear from you soon.

Anton Brevikov
Werewolf Security Services
