>###*Client Contact Message*
>The information you have uncovered confirming Sealine's business practices does not come at a shock to us, but is still deeply concerning. It is by no means unknown for competing businesses to undertake aggressive actions aimed at undermining each other's success, however there are many strategies one can take when faced with a hostile competitor.
>
>I have decided to commit to your services in ensuring our continued productivity in the Aegean region in the face of this threat. You have proved a cost-efficient and capable choice and a resourceful entity to rely upon. I offer a job in return for determining our opponent's next move. It is vital that we- with our more limited resources and inability to recover from a heavy, prepared blow- be able to react ahead of our more lumbering and heavyweight competitor.
>
>Sealine's operations office in Kavala is where their ship logbooks are copied, telephone records stored, orders from head office archived, and computer data backed up. I will offer you 80k total if you are able to find any information that is critical to Sealine's plans with regard to our security. Failing that, I will still pay half that amount for any operational information and communications you are able to recover.
>
>It is concerning that Sealine's relationship with Werewolf seems to be more than just security. Defensive contractors do not actively support their client's needs beyond what they are contracted to do, and it seems far apart from shore security to train and equip offensive actions against our installations. On your suggestion, I have contacted Mr. Petrescu of the Seara Shipping Company and we have begun discussing arrangements to concentrate our resources to our mutual benefit. I assume you are no doubt aware your rate will go up should our talks bear fruit.
