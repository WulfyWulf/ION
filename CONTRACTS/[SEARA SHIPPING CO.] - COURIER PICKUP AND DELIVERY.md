>###*Client Contact Message*
>Good day, we had the pleasure of working with your team on a courier contract earlier this week. As we understand it, things got a bit rough- as we anticipated, otherwise we would not have employed your services. We're impressed by your team's performance and prompt delivery. We have another job for you, if you're interested. 
>
>This one is a bit higher profile than the last, and the pay reflects that. We we wish we didn't have to plan on this one being compromised, but that's not to say we don't expect it to be. Thanks to the information your team brought to our attention in addition to the police report, we're getting closer to who's interfering with our deliveries. 
>
>As for the shootout in Sofia this week, the police so far have little to go off of. Though, it's hardly rare in Altis for witness testimony  to mysteriously be replaced with some greenbacks. Take care of your job, and we'll take care of the mess. Hope to hear from you soon.

>Petrescu
