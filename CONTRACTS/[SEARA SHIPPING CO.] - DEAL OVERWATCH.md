>###*Client Contact Message*
>We have a slightly different job for you, since you've proven to be too capable to waste on quiet delivery jobs. Your impeccable performance has convinced me of the value of your services to supplement our limited manpower.
>
>The product you delivered in your last contract is going to be our part of a deal we plan to execute soon. We have some of our better men on security, but the danger with which our last two deliveries have been accompanied has me certain this won't be enough to guarantee the safety of the deal. This contract would involve, primarily, the security of our assets until they are delivered as part of the deal. In addition, our representatives' safety is a concern we will compensate you for.
>
>You should be aware the deal's conditions have already been agreed upon, and that this exchange should be no more than the typical handover you see in cinema. If our friends on the other end of the deal try to dispute the deal, you have permission to prevent their escape and force the deal's conclusion.  I prefer exchanges be just that- exchanges. Leave the deal making to the telephone.
>
>If the deal's agreed upon conclusion is impossible, you should follow our representatives' instructions. They should brief you before the deal commences. DO NOT, repeat, do not act in such a way that would make the deal's cancellation our fault. Our friends doing the deal should be trustworthy, but in the unlikely event they attempt to take our assets by force, I will pay a bonus if you recover their end of the bargain anyway. 
>
>If you wish to accept, please let us know well in advance. No later than the 19th.
>
>Regarding the last job's difficult conclusion, we will get to the bottom of who is interfering with our business soon. For now, business itself must continue as normal.
