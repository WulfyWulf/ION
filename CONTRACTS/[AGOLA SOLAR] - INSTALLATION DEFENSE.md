>###*Client Contact Message*
>Due to the intelligence you gathered from Sealine's office, we have pinpointed an imminent attack by Werewolf Security Services planned for the 30th on one of our solar installations. We have the place and date, but not the exact time. We have already notified the AAF and they have reluctantly agreed to dispatch soldiers for a few days to guarantee the safety of our installation, and we are relatively certain that Sealine will not try anything with army posted to defend our installation. It is possible that, with the leak of their sensitive information, Sealine will abort the attack.
>
>However, I'm not willing to take the risk of an understrength platoon of army conscripts being motivated enough to put our assets' safety first while fending off a trained PMC attack. The target is our Paros Solar Array, one of our major installations that has been hit by smaller attacks by the thugs you helped dispatch in previous contracts with us. Your job will be to shore up the low quality government troops and multiply their minimal effectiveness in defending the installation.
>
>With our notification of the AAF, it is hopeful that your counterparts at Werewolf will refuse their job with Sealine rather than get into a conflict with the government. If not, they may underestimate the notoriously low quality AAF conscripts and leave themselves open to an effective counter-attack by your own contractors. You must be ready for anything, as we cannot predict the enemy's reaction.
>
>As for the contract, you must protect the solar towers themselves as well as the reflector panels. The panels are just expensive and precisely engineered mirrors, essentially. They are susceptible to damage, especially explosive blasts, from our experience dealing with the recent thugs. However, they are fairly cheap parts of the installation. So long as most of them are intact at the end of things, we'll compensate you for their protection.
>
>The towers, however, are the core of the installation. The reflectors are what focus sunlight energy into the towers, so the towers themselves are where the most expensive and important equipment is housed. They were never designed to survive sabotage or human damage- they're proofed against weather, not explosives. The design necessitates quite a top heavy and spindly design to keep costs down. You must defend against a stand-off attack as well as a point attack- thugs have fired rockets at other towers and severely damaged the supporting columns.
>
>I must apologize for this short notice contract, but I cannot rely on the ineffective Altisian government to guarantee our assets' safety. If the intelligence you recovered is an indication of Sealine's plans in the coming days, I must rely on you instead.
