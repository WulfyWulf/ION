>###*Client Contact Message*
>We have worked with one of your sub-contractors recently in guaranteeing the safe operation of our Sofia power station, and would like to request a follow-up contract. While there was the regrettable use of lethal force against some individuals interested in undermining Agola Solar's productivity, some of the responsible party are still active in the area. With those individuals not dealt with, Agola Solar does not wish to invest in a plan which would force its installations to require constant supervision by a private company. Thus, we have decided to take a proactive approach to this threat to our company's interest.
