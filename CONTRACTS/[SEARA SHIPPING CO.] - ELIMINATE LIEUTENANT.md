>###*Client Contact Message*
>We have had our disagreements with Sealine and their associates, yet their boldness and aggression recently is a disturbing trend that needs to be sharply curbed. This has culminated in the attack on our deal on the 24th. Thanks to your intelligence gathering efforts, we have confirmed the individual responsible for arranging the attacks led by Serbians on our interests. This directed predation on our associates is a conscious attempt to undermine our business with our Balkan associates and cannot be overlooked.
>
>The target is the operations manager of the Sealine Altis office in Kavala, Anton Kovalsky. He is the Number Two at the office, second to the chief manager of the combined oil and shipping receiving station at Sealine Altis. Your intelligence gathered in your investigation with Agola Solar over the past week combined with the Serbian gang boss's testimony you picked up at the failed deal implicates him as the primary negotiator in gathering random Serbians under false or incomplete information to attack our interests over the past month. He is a minor lieutenant in Sealine's handler organization.
>
>Our combined intelligence provides a few locations he is scheduled to visit over the next week. After that period, his schedule is unknown to us. We will provide a bonus if you provide him to us at our receiving warehouse instead of eliminating him, if practical. We do not plan to offer a bonus for a field interrogation if extraction is not possible; we require a more prolonged questioning over an extended period in order to gain any useful information from taking him.
>
>It is assured that Sealine's handler will not be pleased by this retaliation. However, it is necessary to demonstrate our ability to answer to this blatant aggression against our interests. We lost our representatives in the failed deal undermined by Sealine's interference, representatives which included important individuals in our company. To not react with swift and sharp consequence would encourage continued aggressive behavior that has led to this situation.
