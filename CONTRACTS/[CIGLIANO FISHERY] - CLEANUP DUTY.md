>###*Client Contact Message*
>We're happy the last job went well, but we've got some loose ends we need you to tie up. While you cleaned up much of our former associate's muscle in the last job, we have to get rid of the associate himself and his cronies. That's just the way our line of business works, you know? Unfortunately, these guys are making it difficult by running to another group of undesirables for asylum. 
>
>Small detail, but our friend's contacts are with the FIA group of rebels duking it out with the army north of the capital. They've already discussed us, and they've got an attractive offer for their contact that they're likely to accept. So that wouldn't bode well for our business if they pair up and decide to get in our hair. 
>
>They plan to meet on the 31st. You aren't taking out all of FIA, don't worry! Just the guys that our boys are in touch with. You just have to find them. We've got the address of the safehouse of our friends, so follow them and take them all out once they're nice and cozy together. We'll pay you on your word, so we don't need to tell you to be honest about confirming the kills, okay?
>
>Do well for us, and we'll have more work for you! Grazie!
