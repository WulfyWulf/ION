>###*Client Contact Message*
>Good day! We represent certain interests in the Aegean Sea fishery industry and have received your information from some friends.
>
>We have a lot of competitors, you understand. The fishing industry is a tough business, especially with Greece's economic decline. It sometimes is necessary to be proactive in order to stay ahead. We have had some disagreements with one of our suppliers, and have asked them to no longer fish in our economic territory.
>
>Of course, business deals move slowly! So, we ask you to help hasten our supplier's exit from Altis's seaboard. The start of this will be the disruption of their logistics. Unfortunately, we're not sure where the target shipment is going to be offloaded. We have a rough area and a time window to expect, but not much more to go off of than that.
>
>Ideally, we would like you to retrieve our former supplier's shipment, but simply forcing the shipment to be aborted by scaring either the shipment boat or the men picking it up would be satisfactory as well.
>
>We'll give you more details if you decide to accept, please respond by the 21st.
>
