>###Sources and Costs
>- Piranha Defense
>  - The brits from Pyrgos we worked with on the boat intercept.
>  - Have been around here enough to know some stuff or worked with them before.
> - Agola Solar
>   - A shot in the dark, but might have some business with them if the phone numbers incident is more than a coincidence.
>   - They owe us a favor or two, so it shouldn't be much of a problem to trade some information with them if they do know anything.
>   - If anything, we can at least introduce the two to each other. Might open up some business opportunities with us in the middle.
>- Romanian Armed Forces
>  - Probably working with this group in some form or another, either mutual profit or trafficking.
>  - If they are, could be a decent source of somewhat reliable information on their history.
>- Mediterranean Shipping Authority
>  - Spanish based, keeps tabs on shipping traffic.
>  - Very basic information, and they aren't the type to take bribes, but should be useful for cross examining.
