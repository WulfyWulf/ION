##Intelligence Outline

>***
>
>###Goals
>- Establish target's background and history of business, legal or otherwise.
>- Cross-examine publicly available information about the target with other sources to uncover anything they may be hiding.
>- Establish any security needs the target has, and if they are dissatisfied with their existing security solutions.
>- Determine if target is worth working for should they request our services.
>
>***
>
>###Risks
>- As Seara Shipping- a competitor to the target- is a client of ours, either side may be offended by inquiries into the target.
>  - Seara's background check shows they don't seem likely to be offended if we look into their competitors.
>

>###Sources and Costs
>- Seara Shipping Co.
>  - An obvious start, they have had some stiff arguments with Sealine and have looked into the target themselves.
>  - If a joint investigation can be launched, it would reduce the overall cost of this proposal.
>- Piranha Defense
>  - Was apparently approached at some point to work as on-ship security off the horn of Africa, but Piranha turned them down.
>  - Could inquire as to why they declined, PMCs generally share information about suspect clients with each other pro bono.
>- Mediterranean Shipping Authority
>  - Spanish based, acts as EU's regulatory body in the Mediterranean.
>  - Had a publicized row with Sealine demanding investigation into its alleged illegal trafficking.   
>  - MSA backed down after heavy pressure from the Russian government.
>      - Not a group to share private information, but this is a fresh wound for them and they might be open to discussing it with us.
>- Agola Solar
>  - In investigating Seara Shipping, spoke with Agola Solar briefly about their familiarity with Seara.
>  - They had no leads on Seara's background, but Sealine came up as a shipping company they had a sharp disagreement over construction material delivery for their solar plants.
