>###Sources and Costs
>- Aegean Fishing Register
>  - Greek based and corrupt, knows quite a bit about front businesses and traffics goods knowingly.
>  - Reliability is sketchy, but a good start for understanding the client's history.
> - Sardinia Hatchery and Fishery
>   - One of the major Sardinian "fishing" businesses, a front for Sardinian crime families.
>   - Competitor to Cigliano and might have some good information for us, for a price.
> - Local Fishermen
>   - Hardest of the sources to track down, but generally fall under those harassed into protection by the client or under another organization's protection.
>   - Most are small businesses or individual fishermen, and should be okay with talking with a security company about their arrangements with organized crime.
>   - Might be pricey to get them talking, but it should be easy to get ahold of some good information about the client themselves.
