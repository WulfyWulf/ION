##Intelligence Outline

>***
>
>###Goals
>- Establish origin of Russian phone numbers taken from Sofia shootout and the power plant Foreman.
>- Verify or refute any correlation between the acquired phone numbers.
>- Determine if any correlation is dangerous to us should we proceed with either of the associated clients.
>
>***
>
>###Risks
>- No information is available about the phone numbers' origins?
>- Relation between phone numbers is too weak to draw conclusions?
>
>***
>
>###Sources and Costs
>- Seara Shipping Co.
>  - Probably just as interested in this conclusion as we are.
>  - Likely to exchange any information we have evenly.
>- Agola Solar
>  - Significant stake in discovering who is financing subversion against their operations.
>  - Also likely to assist us with any information we can mutually share.
>- Altis Armed Forces
>  - Possible information on the alleged rebel attack that coincided with Seara Shipping's delivery job.
>  - Won't part with this information without cost, and it may be unrelated to the phone numbers after all.
>- Republic of Altis
>  - Should have at least some knowledge of any cover businesses run by Russian nationals, despite Altis's lawlessness.
>  - Not useful information on its own, but could be useful to cross-examine other info.
>  - Not likely to be expensive to ask for- Altis's internal affairs are hardly airtight.
>- Russian Embassy
>  - Might help, but it won't be easy to get them to spill. Might have to dig around for a good contact.
>- Greek Intelligence
>  - Keeps a modest eye on Altisian affairs since independence, might have some information we can use.
>  - Corrupt to the core, but charge a pretty penny for info.
