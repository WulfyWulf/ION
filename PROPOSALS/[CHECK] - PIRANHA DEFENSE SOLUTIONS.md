>###Sources and Costs
>- Altis Armed Forces
>  - Has publicly sponsored Piranha for the past five months, and they've been working together longer.
>  - This sponsorship might skew information we get from them. Will be necessary to cross-examine for any bias.
> - South African Defense Force
>  - Interestingly, a former client prominently displayed on Piranha's publicity brochure.
> - Various African States
>  - Togo, French Guiana, Sierra Lione, and a few other states have used Piranha's services.
>  - Piranha seems to prefer larger contracts on a more conventional scale than commercial interests.
> - Agola Solar
>   - They briefly mentioned Piranha as some of their security options but didn't agree on price.
>   - Likely, Piranha's preferred contract scale was too big for Agola Solar to meet, so they went with us.
