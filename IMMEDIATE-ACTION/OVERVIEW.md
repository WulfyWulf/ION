##*CONTRACT OVERVIEW*
***
>**CLIENT:** JAPANESE NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY
>
>**PAYOUT:** 700/Contractor, 1000 Company
***

###OUTLINE
>You are to provide offensive power to local police forces in clearing the town of Ryoushi Mura, where Triad criminals have taken hostages. Your goal is to clear out hostile strongpoints and rescue the hostages such that local police forces can retake control of the situation.

>You will be supported by local police forces in maintaining the cordon and closing the net behind you as you clear town blocks. Ensure the safety of local civilians and any hostages- multiple civilian or hostage casualties are unacceptable for fulfillment of this contract.


###BACKGROUND
>It is 5:30 AM. Triad gang members have escaped from a raid on an Akatoshi fishing warehouse used as a front for illegal activity. They have fled in six vehicles with the aid of other local Triads and were pursued to Ryoushi Mura, where they were forced to stop. Four officers have been shot already, and a cordon has been drawn to prevent the Triads' escape. The JSDF has been called in to assist with controlling bridge and sea access. They will act only in a support role but are cleared to engage any threats that present themselves.

>Most of the civilian population has been evacuated, but a handful remain in their homes or have been taken hostage by the Triads. The Triads are demanding they be allowed safe passage or the hostages will be shot at daybreak. 

###EXECUTION
>You can enter either by the edges of town or by boat (courtesy of JSDF). If you enter by town, you will have the assistance of local law enforcement to secure areas behind you. Entering by boat will allow you to approach from the beach, where movement is lighter.

>You must secure hostages held in two buildings, 1 and 2 (t2,t3), in order to complete the contract.

>You will have the support of a police helicopter that will provide updates on criminal movement in the town. 

###THREAT ANALYSIS
>There are around 20 Triads taking shelter in town supported by their local security employment force of 8-10 private security. The Triads are armed with a strong complement of submachineguns and assault rifles in addition to lighter civilian weapons. The PMCs appear to have light armor and PDWs.

>Aerial surveillance shows about 15 strong surrounding the hostage buildings 1 and 2, with the rest dispersed at strongpoints and ambush areas in the town.

###NOTES TO CONSIDER
>The town is known for its dense bamboo growth that rises higher than some trees, making FLIR of limited use in most of the town. Reports from police helicopter may be of limited use.

>Police on the Kerama Islands are limited in number and are already strained by the need to maintain the cordon. Expect limited support if you are caught without a clear path to help you.
