##*CONTRACT OVERVIEW*
***
>**CLIENT:** TRIADS
>
>**PAYOUT:** 1000/Contractor, 1000 Company
***

###OUTLINE
>Your objective is to demolish the gas processing complex under construction at the south end of Fujinwan Industrial Zone.
>
>The complex consists of four storage tanks connected to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction unit built into the side of the mountain (f1). The demolition will target the support columns and overhanging roof being built to contain the complex. Successful demolition will bring the upper section onto the interior and destroy the entire complex.

###BACKGROUND
>The LNG processing unit and control building are being built *in situ* and will connect with Akatoshi port once construction of the dam is completed. Natural gas will be piped to the complex from the main terminal at Akatoshi port from the home islands for processing before returning to the port hub for distribution by ship as LNG. It is the largest and most expensive addition to the Fujinwan Industrial Zone and currently under a construction by a Yakuza operated contractor. Our Triad client wishes to distance the rival Yakuza from their client, a major Japanese energy company and sole pursuant of Japanese LNG industry.
>
>It is important to note that no LNG is present on the facility currently. The complex is not operational yet and will not be so until next year. If you are successful, the complex will never become operational.

###EXECUTION
>You will target the support columns that hold the completed roof of the structure up. Cutting charges placed on a majority of the columns will bring the roof down into the lower level construction area which will be economically impossible to recover from.
>
> The roof is also the construction site for most of the administration buildings for the complex, and has several entrances down into the lower level of the complex where the LNG processing train is under construction. Access to the lower level is by road- to be turned into a tunnel by construction's completion- and by the access stairways on the roof.
>
>Access to the Industrial Zone is restricted. Passes must be presented for entry by road. Anyone not appropriately dressed as a construction worker is likely to be stopped by security or the Yakuza thugs responsible for protecting the construction.

>Excavation charges-if not brought by the field team- can be procured on site on the north end of the Industrial Zone, where they are used to break up rock for tunneling and excavation. One charge per support column will be sufficient.

###THREAT ANALYSIS
>There are around a dozen strong Yakuza thugs in the area. Construction workers are all on Yakuza payroll and may be armed or thugs themselves. Workers vary from 20 to 50 depending on day and hour. There are overt sentries posted as well as a central observation and control tower that commands a view over the entire industrial zone.

>Reports show most Yakuza at the site are armed with pistols and submachine guns. There is a minority of assault rifles and the control tower is a capable sniper position.

###NOTES TO CONSIDER
>The gorge that separates the north and south sectors of the Industrial Zone is difficult to cross to the other side of (f4). The dam and bridge do not have any suitable approaches for vehicles. Any quick mobilization from the north sector attempting to get to the south sector will be forced to take the main service road bridge which should give you ample opportunity to engage.

>Though mobilization to the other sector is difficult, the distance across the gorge is large enough that whichever side has more suitable weapons over range will be able to command both sides of the gorge.

>A police response is not likely this far out of town in any measure to be able to act. Any first responders will avoid confrontation while awaiting backup. You will have about half an hour for any suitable police presence to develop. However, it will become apparent that any large explosion following a gunfight at the Industrial Zone may be an act outside the police's ability to respond to, and the JSDF will respond. You can suppose a 10 minute response time from the barracks at Fukaji Jima once a major explosion is reported.

>You must not allow any Yakuza to tail you back to our office. Ensure any pursuers have been shaken before returning to Akatoshi.
