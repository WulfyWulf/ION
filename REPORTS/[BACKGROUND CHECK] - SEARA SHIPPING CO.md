>>####Goals Summary
>>1. ✓ Verify Seara Shipping's background and the client's overall integrity.
>>  *  As presumed, Seara Shipping Co. is the main international presence of the Martinescu criminal enterprise, a Romanian mob organization that has been active since around 2004. 
>>  * The Martinescu clan enjoys good contact with a variety of functions in Romania's government and has spread its influence through the Balkan region. It has eclipsed most other domestic clans in the area and spread through the Black Sea, with its newest venture in the Aegean. They deal mainly in drugs, arms, and human trafficking, bank fraud, and counterfeiting. 
>>  * New in the criminal scene, they have pushed for co-existence with the larger operations they can't absorb. Most of the Romanian groups tend to be amateurish, fickle, and end up bulled around and extinguished by the more established Albanian and Hungarian operations, but the Martinescu group has managed to earn some standing and works professionally with the mentioned Balkan groups.
>>  * Overall, they have a fairly good reputation and have used private companies in the past with good record.
>>2. ✓ Predict the client's intentions of our continued employment.
>>  * The Martinescu group's expansion into Greece and the Republic of Altis is an attempt to push out of the Black Sea and gain a presence on the Aegean side of the Balkans without infringing on territory of organizations they consider "associates" (Albanians, Serbs, and Italians mostly). 
>>  * As they are still a smaller group, they do not have as much manpower to spare and have used private companies to shore up their operations in difficult areas. They employ a number of Kazakhs and Azerbaijanis as "movers", but rarely as enforcers.
>>  * They have briefly used Piranha Defense (primarily British with some French and Belgians) as well as Werewolf Security Services (mostly Russian), but have been dissatisfied with the prices demanded. They seem to be in the market for grunts who can do work they cannot fill with their existing manpower rather than a military company, given the lack of much confrontation with opposing groups so far.
>>  * The pressure from their recent trouble with unknown interference in their drug trafficking has made their need for competent contractor services greater than when they attempted to use Piranha, which makes them more dependent on our services. 
>>      * This might explain the high premium in the 4/15 delivery contract. Apparently, they were pessimistic about their shipment's delivery and were surprised to take receipt of all of it, thanks to your work. 
>>3. ✓ Determine if the client has any dangerous enemies or is withholding information that could endanger our safety.
>>  * Martinescu had a major disagreement in February over Black Sea smuggling routes with Sealine- a Russian oil company that scalps most of the fuel used by Greece and Altis, along with most of the Mediterranean proper. Sealine moves a great quantity of the refined fuel from the  Caucasus and has been criticized for alleged involvement with Russian organized crime.
>>  * In March, a Sealine tanker- the *MV Kotlas*- was involved in a ramming incident with a Seara bulk cargo ship- *MV Biruinta*- in the Black Sea over an alleged aggressive maneuver by the *Kotlas* during a port queue disagreement in Constantinople. Damage was moderate to the *Biruinta* and mild to the *Kotlas*.
>>  * Sealine does operate in Altis, but the Martinescu group has not made any mention of any operational concerns with Sealine. Sealine has, however, reportedly hired Werewolf Security Services for at-sea and docked security, including at port in Kavala.
>>4. ✓ Determine if continued employment by the client is in our best interests.
>>  * Seara and its parent criminal organization seem relatively trustworthy and professional enough to warrant continuing our services with them. They have been eager for our continued employment and may be facing tougher competition with their current rate of expansion into the Mediterranean. Highly recommended to continue with this client.

>###Sources and Costs
>- Piranha Defense *- $3,000*
>  - The brits from Pyrgos we worked with on the boat intercept.
>  - Have been around here enough to know some stuff or worked with them before.
> - Agola Solar *- $0, no leads*
>   - A shot in the dark, but might have some business with them if the phone numbers incident is more than a coincidence.
>   - They owe us a favor or two, so it shouldn't be much of a problem to trade some information with them if they do know anything.
>   - If anything, we can at least introduce the two to each other. Might open up some business opportunities with us in the middle.
>- Romanian Armed Forces *- $5,000, good sources, pointed to some Albanian contacts*
>  - Probably working with this group in some form or another, either mutual profit or trafficking.
>  - If they are, could be a decent source of somewhat reliable information on their history.
>- *Sisseri Family Syndicate - $8,000, bulk of the target's information came from here*
>  - Albanians, lots of arms and human trafficking. Not nice people, but had a lot of information to share.
>  - Worked with the client and have a shaky alliance, though expressed some concerns about the client's rate of growth.
>- Mediterranean Shipping Authority *- $0, just an inquiry*
>  - Spanish based, keeps tabs on shipping traffic.
>  - Very basic information, and they aren't the type to take bribes, but should be useful for cross examining.
