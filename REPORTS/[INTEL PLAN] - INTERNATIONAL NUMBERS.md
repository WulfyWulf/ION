>###Sources and Costs
>- Seara Shipping Co.
>  - Probably just as interested in this conclusion as we are.
>  - Likely to exchange any information we have evenly.
>- Agola Solar
>  - Significant stake in discovering who is financing subversion against their operations.
>  - Also likely to assist us with any information we can mutually share.
>- Altis Armed Forces
>  - Possible information on the alleged rebel attack that coincided with Seara Shipping's delivery job.
>  - Won't part with this information without cost, and it may be unrelated to the phone numbers after all.
>- Republic of Altis
>  - Should have at least some knowledge of any cover businesses run by Russian nationals, despite Altis's lawlessness.
>  - Not useful information on its own, but could be useful to cross-examine other info.
>  - Not likely to be expensive to ask for- Altis's internal affairs are hardly airtight.
>- Russian Embassy
>  - Might help, but it won't be easy to get them to spill. Might have to dig around for a good contact.
>- Greek Intelligence
>  - Keeps a modest eye on Altisian affairs since independence, might have some information we can use.
>  - Corrupt to the core, but charge a pretty penny for info.


##Report
***
>###Goals Summary
>1. ✓ Establish origin of Russian phone numbers taken from Sofia shootout and the power plant Foreman.
>  * The phone numbers consist of 5 different numbers in varying districts in the Russian Federation. These phone numbers will be broken down by where they were found and their location according to what information is available about them.
>       1. Sofia Thugs. Rostov-on-Don, Russian Federation. Sealine's Black Sea office.
>       2. Sofia Thugs. Novorossiysk, Krasnodar, Russian Federation. An office of a Serbian grain company.
>       3. Foreman. St. Petersburg, Russian Federation. Sealine's main office.
>       4. Foreman. Moscow, Russian Federation. An automobile dealership.
>       5. Foreman. Krasnodar, Russian Federation. A farming machinery distributor, importing mainly from the Balkans.
>  * From this information, and from the prisoners gathered in your ill-fated contract on the 24th, we can determine that the primary actors in both engagements were Serbs collected and employed loosely outside of any organized Balkan mob through the network of Balkan contacts in these phone numbers. It was an intentional red herring set up by their employer to distance themselves and gravitate blame to the Serbian mob- members of which you engaged and took prisoner of on the 24th.
>  * The prisoners you took on the 24th had no relation to the Serbs killed in operations for Agola Solar (4/17) or Seara Shipping (4/12). However, according to the mob prisoners, their men were also sent to disrupt the package delivery job for Seara (4/15) and were killed. They were told by their Russian contacts that they were knocking off an Albanian delivery, and not Romanian.
>2. ✓ Verify or refute any correlation between the acquired phone numbers.
>  * Sealine has a controlling interest in Agola Solar's success in the Aegean. Agola Solar has boomed in growth in the past few years as an alternative energy source for Greece and Altis from the oil power plants they have traditionally relied upon. Sealine's tanker fleet is the primary mover of refined oil products in the Mediterranean, and has been notorious for scalping their refined oil prices in conjunction with Caucasus oil conglomerate CaspOil.
>  * CaspOil itself is a subsidized entity that has been bailed out twice, 1998 and 2004, by the Russian government and is the main oil reserve for the Russian Armed Forces. CaspOil has come under heavy international criticism for financing or at the least in the control of a powerful Russian mafia group- the Rossikov group.
>  * The Rossikov group is, in turn, a competitor on the Black Sea area for trafficking of drugs, arms, etc. They are in direct competition with our Romanian contacts in Seara Shipping Co. They also deal in stolen automobiles- the dealership from the #4 phone number itself has a reputation for one in five cars sold being back in the "new" lot within a month.
>3. ✓ Determine if any correlation is dangerous to us should we proceed with either of the associated clients.
>  * Dangerous, but lucrative. Agola Solar and Seara Shipping both have a lot at risk now that a large network of crime is flexing its muscles at them and trying to push them out of business. Sealine commands a sizable contract of Werewolf's overseas brigade that it nominally uses for the security of its vessels and port assets. You have firsthand experience how loose the definition of that contract is twisted by them.
>  * If Agola Solar and Seara Shipping were to assist each other's interests, their combined resources would give them a chance of pushing back against the Russian influence in the Aegean. Getting them to cooperate may be difficult, and we want to make sure we are the company they turn to when they have a big, game-ending contract, and not Piranha.

>###Sources and Costs
>- Seara Shipping Co. - $0
>  - Were very interested in this. They funded their own side of the investigation and shared it with us *pro bono*.
>- Agola Solar - $0
>  - Ditto with Seara, especially once the connection was made obvious with Werewolf's investment in the assaults and murders on Agola Solar's personnel.
>- Altis Armed Forces - $6000
>  - Turns out, the bombing of the radar installation is still unknown. The rebels did not claim responsibility, as they have for other incidents. This very likely means that the bombing happening on the same night as the hugely important delivery for Seara was not a coincidence, and was intended to make transport of the goods impossible if the Serbians hired to intercept the supposedly Albanian dropoff failed (they did).
>- Republic of Altis - $8000
>  - We now know much of what Altis relies upon for its oil reserves and the stake Sealine has in keeping half of Altis's national expenditure flowing into their pockets. Altis even had a dock-to-storage pipeline constructed specifically for Sealine's tankers.
>  - Despite the expenditure, Altis doesn't want to lose Sealine's business either, and has been resisting Agola Solar's proposed plan to completely wean Altis off foreign oil.
>- Russian Embassy - $20000
>  - A clerk was kind enough to provide records of Werewolf's activities in Altis, tracked by the Russians (being Werewolf's home country) as demanded by the UN International Private Military Act and normally only to be provided upon a UN investigation of crimes committed by a PMC.
>  - Werewolf has left their barracks in Kavala a few times in the past month for scheduled reasons, but two incidents provide insight into their involvement in Sealine's agenda- 4/17 and 4/24, Werewolf's security teams left without a planned purpose and with only a minimal mandatory notification to the embassy. 4/17 was the SUVs and helicopter you saw on the road to Sofia after hitting the Serbian bandits for Agola Solar, and 4/24 was the incident over the deal for Seara.
>  - Werewolf also left their barracks on the evening of 4/15 for a scheduled "parts delivery" receipt from Pyrgos. This was also the night of the delivery job for Seara.
>- Greek Intelligence - $10000
>  - CaspOil has been a problem for Greece since their economic decline. They have no money to finance alternative energy sources and CaspOil's prices have only gone up, making them just slightly more attractive than the typically undesirable Middle Eastern alternatives.
>  - Their investigation into Sealine also revealed a human trafficking incident that was overlooked and buried until our cash dug up its records. This points to Sealine's involvement with the Rossikov group's Black Sea organized crime network.
